# Inventory-Management-System-

Introduction
Project Overview: Start with a brief overview of your project.
"I developed an Inventory Management System using Angular for the frontend, SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for the database, and C# with the .NET framework for the backend. This system helps users manage their inventory by tracking stock levels, recording purchases from suppliers, and sales to customers."
Main Features

"The system allows users to:
1. Track the current stock and details of products.
2. Update product information, including minimum and maximum quantities and prices.
3. Record purchases from suppliers and sales to customers.
4. Add or delete suppliers and customers.
5. Track all transactions, both purchases and sales, and view product-wise transaction history.
6. Identify out-of-stock products, ensuring timely restocking.
7. Monitor understocked products to prevent shortages.
8. Detect overstocked products to optimize inventory levels."
